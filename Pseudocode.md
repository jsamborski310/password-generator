Append to a string. 

# What does my app need to get from the User?

- Password length. Verify  it's between 8 - 128 characters. 

- Should the following be included?
    - numbers
    - lowercase
    - uppercase
    - special characters

For each of the above, DECLARE a variable to store the value. 

# What steps are needed to build a password?

- Asking user for criteria.
- Make a list that only has the type of characters matching the required options
- After they select, create a new list with their selections. (Not the best strategy.)
- Randomly select a character from my list. 
- Add our randomly selected character to our password string.
- Repeat until the password reaches the requested length.
